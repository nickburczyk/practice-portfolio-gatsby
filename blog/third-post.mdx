# Writing your first React Hook...

React hooks are incredibly helpful. We use them already inside a component in the form of
`useState()` or `useEffect()`.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>You've clicked {count} times.</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click to increase</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>Click to decrease</button>
    </>
  );
};
```

But did you know you can hide stateful changes in a react hook of your own design? This can help
keep your components clean and un-bloated.

In the example above, you have a heading with the count and two buttons to increase and decrease the count.

But if you moved the count state to a hook, your code can be cleaner.

```jsx
// useCount.js

import React, { useState } from "react";

// when naming hooks, always begin them with the "use" keyword.
const useCount = (initialCount = 0) => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount);

  const increase = () => setCount((prev) => prev + 1);
  const decrease = () => setCount((prev) => prev + 1);

  return {
    count,
    increase,
    decrease,
  };
};
```

Here, we have:

- created a hook `useCount` (it is important that your hook names start with `use`)
- allowed the user to determine what the initial value should be (but will use 0 as a default if
  nothing is passed,
- used the same useState method to track state,
- created functions that increase and decrease the count
- given them more intuitive names to use in your component.

Here is what it would look like to implement it:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { useCount } from "./useCount";

const Counter = () => {
  const { count, increase, decrease } = useCount();

  return (
    <>
      <h1>You've clicked {count} times.</h1>
      <button onClick={increase}>Click to increase</button>
      <button onClick={decrease}>Click to decrease</button>
    </>
  );
};
```

This is a minor upgrade in such a small component, but you can already see how much more readable
this component has become. Here are the important changes:

- We destructure the new functions from our `useCount` hook.
- We have passed the new functions into the button's `onClick` handlers
  - There is no need to "invoke" the function here with `()=>increase()` as there was before,
    because what is being passed is already a function ready to be invoked when you click.
- We have cleaned up syntax that requires extra cognitive effort to decipher

While this is not a huge optimization because of the size of these components, the utility in
bigger applications can make great gains. Hooks are great for API calls, manipulating data you
will need in the component, or control something bigger like logged in status.

The only way to get better at coding is to code a lot. Go try it out!
