# It's the journey _and_ the destination

I came to development later in life. I was always curious. I was a perennial
self-learner. I did tutorials learning the same "first steps" until my eyes bled.

But no matter what you think about your journey, all the people that you (will) work with started
in the exact same place. Maybe they did it in a college course, or maybe with their friends in
their college dorm. But everyone has been there.

The truth is that the only way to get good at coding is to write a _ton_ of code. And you'll only
really do that once you land your first job. In your first job, you will see what real production
apps have going on. You will see the structure, the patterns and, if it is a project with a team
worth its salt, you will be able to jump right in. Slowly at first, and quickly ramp up.

## Don't be afraid to ask questions

The world of software development moves _incredibly_ fast. New technologies and trends are being
born every day. The likelyhood that you have worked with every technology in your company's stack
is highly unlikely.

You will always be learning, and you will always be facing things you haven't seen before.

> Humility is the only remedy for imposter syndrome.

When faced with these things, you must ask questions. Humility is truly the only remedy for
imposter syndrome. Asking a colleague to explain something to you is often the best way to learn
it quickly, and it has the added benefit of helping build team camaraderie.

## Some tips for getting better quickly

1. **_Get good at debugging -_** Error messages can be intimidating. But if you force yourself to
   sort through them, you will learn more about how the development process works. Plus, _debugging code
   will be a big part of what you do as a developer anyway_
2. **_Try to look up solutions before tapping a colleague for help -_** If your colleague can fix it
   just by looking at it, that is why they are more senior than you (for now). But no one wants to be
   bothered by something that you could have googled yourself.
3. **_Don't be afraid of pair coding -_** This practice is a great way to learn. This is usually done
   where one person "drives" while the other gives input and solutions. I was _terrified_ of this when I
   started, because I was afraid of being found out. But these are valuable opportunities to learn more
   about how developers think, how to navigate your file structure, and the difference between good and
   sloppy solutions.

## Conclusion

You. Can. Do. This. But no one has ever gotten where they want to be on their own. Be willing to
humbly ask for help and soak up everything you can from the people around you. You're not an
imposter. We all just have a lot to learn.
